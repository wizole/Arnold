<h1>Car Rental System</h1>
<p>A car rental reservation system (CRSS) is an online or offline software tool that allows customers to book rental vehicles and make reservations. These systems often include features like:

    Search: Customers can search for cars available for rental at a specific location and date.
    Pricing: Customers can see the rates for different types of cars and rental periods.
    Booking: Customers can book a car by providing their contact information and payment details.
    Confirmation: Customers receive a confirmation email with details of their reservation.

When renting a car in advance, customers visit a rental website or app, choose a vehicle, and make a reservation with payment if necessary. On the scheduled day, they pick up the car at the rental location after verification and explanation of terms by an agent. Upon return, the car is inspected.

Automating these processes enhances service quality. Let's explore how each CRRS module contributes to this.</p>
